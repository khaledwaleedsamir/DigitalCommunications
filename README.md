Third Year Digital Communications Projects
# First Project
In this project, a simulation of a software radio transmitter is done using MATLAB. The transmitter's primary function is to convert digital data into modulated waveforms ready for transmission over the air or through cables using line codes. Three different line codes are under test; their statistics (Mean and Autocorrelation) and Power Spectral Density (PSD) are computed. The line codes under test are **Unipolar Signaling**, **Polar Non-Return to Zero** and **Polar Return to Zero**
